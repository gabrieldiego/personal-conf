sudo apt-get install bluez python-gobject python-dbus

-> python-gobject and python-dbus are needed for the python scripts
   bluez-simple-agent and bluez-test-device to work.

-> Discover the hciX location of the dongle with:

hcitool dev

Devices:
        hci0    00:11:95:00:1A:CF

-> (i) Your Bluetooth device will have a different id.

sudo bluez-simple-agent hci0 XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
-> XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX is the MAC or BT ADD or BlueTooth Address of the bt
   device. Press the reset or pair button on your keyboard, simple-agent will
   ask to specify a pin like 1111, then type that pin on the bt keyboard and
   your bt keyboard is paired.

sudo bluez-test-device trusted XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX yes
-> To set the device as trusted

sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart
-> To restart the bluetooth daemon.

-> Check if the device is added:
dmesg|tail
-> The last lines will list your device.

-> Found the method for 10.04 and 11.04 here:
   http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-bluetooth/msg13445.html

-> Additionally, according to this thread
   (http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=6838), it may be
   necessary, after authenticating your keyboard, to run:

sudo bluez-test-input connect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
-> To actually get the Bluetooth device to connect to the computer (I had to
   do this when using a Logitech Dinovo Edge with a generic Bluetooth adapter).
   After this, set the device to be trusted as above, and the connection
   should persist upon reboot.
